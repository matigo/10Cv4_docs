# 10Centuries v4 Documentation

This is a public repository containing the API and Web Interface documentation for Version 4 of the [10Centuries publishing platform](https://10centuries.org). The upcoming Version 5 docs will be in a different repository. Everyone is free to contribute, fork, distribute, and comment on these documents as they choose.

### Notes

This documentation is written in Simple Markdown formatting for the sake of simplicity and portability. The goal of this project is to have an always-accurate, up-to-date location for every public feature and function available in 10Centuries. The contents of this repository will also be found in HTML format at [docs.10centuries.org](https://docs.10centuries.org) in the future as the documentation becomes more complete.

### Requests

In order to keep this documentation consistent, I'd like to make the following requests:

* API endpoint documentation should be 1 file per endpoint (info for `/invites` should be in `/api/en/invites.md`)
* Images for documentation should be in `.jpg` or `.png` format and stored in `/img` using the name of the endpoint or page, the feature, and a number such as: `/img/profile_menu_1.jpg`

### Wrap Up
